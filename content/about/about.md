I'm a Master's student studying ECE at the University of Florida. My professional interests are
digital design/DV for FPGAs and ASICs, and software/hardware security. I am also passionate about
teaching and helping students learn by doing. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, playing board games,
reading, and exploring the outdoors.

Check out my most recent [projects](/projects) and [posts](/posts) on the sidebar to the left (sorry mobile users).

I'm not exactly sure what this website will hold. I'm planning for it to mostly be chatter about
projects that I work on, with some technical/tutorial articles. Who knows, I could have some
blogging in my future as well :).
